# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Social-and-Demographic-Determinants-of-Youth-Substance-Use-in-Canada
üìä Overview
This project explores the influence of social and demographic factors on substance use among Canadian youth (Grades 7‚Äì12) using data from the 2018/2019 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol, and Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Through a blend of statistical and machine learning techniques‚Äîincluding Bayesian logistic regression, Lasso, multilevel models, and propensity score matching‚Äîwe uncover the strongest predictors of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use.

üéØ Key Objectives
Understand how peer influence, bullying, and socioeconomic background affect substance use.

Quantify risk across demographic segments (e.g., age, gender, income).

Identify effective modeling approaches for causal inference and prediction.

Provide actionable insights to inform evidence-based youth prevention strategies.

üß™ Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Assessed smoking and drug use trends by gender, grade, household income, urban vs. rural location, and social influence.

Modeling Techniques:

Bayesian Logistic Regression

Lasso-Penalized Logistic Regression

Multilevel Logistic Regression

Propensity Score Matching (PSM)

Random Forests

Each method contributes a different lens‚Äîranging from probabilistic inference to causal impact estimation.

üîç Notable Findings
Social influence is the most significant predictor across all substance types. Nearly 99.98% of smokers reported peer influence.

Students exposed to bullying or with lower household incomes were significantly more likely to engage in substance use.

Multilevel models outperformed others in predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.79), capturing school-level variance.

Propensity score matching effectively estimated the causal effect of peer influence on smoking behavior.
